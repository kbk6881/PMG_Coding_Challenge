# PMG Programming Challenges

A few small programming challenges that let us see how job candidates work.

## What Languages Can I Use?

Just about anything you like, but we work mostly with...

- PHP
- JavaScript (node & in browser)
- Python
- Go

## How do I ask questions?

[Open an issue](https://github.com/AgencyPMG/ProgrammingChallenges/issues).

## How long should I spend on this?

Take your time and do your best work. The code you produce here should be a very
good indicator of how you would code in a production environment.
If you find a problem is taking a long time, let us know!
Chances are it's probably too big for this set of challenges.

## Can I use third-party libraries?

Sure! We're interested in seeing how you work, treat this challenge like any
other project.

## How do I submit my answer?

Send an email to tech@pmg.com or reach out to the person who gave you the
challenge. Feel free to send an archive (a tar or zipball are fine) or link us
to a public pastebin (github gist, etc) or repository (bitbucket, github, etc).
